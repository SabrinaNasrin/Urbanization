# Urbanization

<strong>Project Title:</strong> A 2D graphics proejct using C++ OpenGL <br>

<strong>Environment:</Strong> <br>
•	OpenGL (Open Graphics Library).<br>
•	C/C++.<br>

<strong>Editor:</strong><br>
•	CodeBlocks (16.01).<br>

<strong>Objective:</strong><br>
Due to Population explosion, deforestation, river filling and other environmental hazards which are done by humans are eventually destroying the beauty of our country as well as our precious world. What we can do is, control the deforestation and implant more and more plants and also prevent filling the rivers illegally to save our country. Our small initiative can bring a beautiful new world to our successors.<br>
#### Output:
•	In the first scene, I gave an illustration of a village where there were huts, so many trees and river with boats 20 years ago.<br>
•	In the next scene I have shown that 15 years ago from now, some trees are cut down.<br>
•	Then I have shown that 10 years ago, some buildings are built and more trees are cut down.<br>
•	Then in the next scene I have given that 5 years ago more buildings are built, river is filled to make roads and only few trees are left.<br>
•	Then I have shown the present days that there is no huts, trees or river rather the village is converted into a city.<br>

Through my project I wanted to show that how our villages are converting into cities and deforestation, filling river etc. are creating imbalance in our environment eventually resulting in different natural calamities.
